# QuantumDynamics
This repository contains: 
1. The "Reaction Path Hamiltonian" program package as developed during my tenure at the Laboratory of Physical Chemistry at ETH Zürich in the lab of Prof. Martin Quack [1]
and presented in [2]. Implemented in FORTRAN. Based on a previous version of the RPH-method developed in [3,4].
2. Various Mathematica [5] notebooks to calculate and vizualise effective 1D and 2D quantum wavepackets based on numerically calculated eigenfunctions on a grid, as presented in [1,2]. Wavepacket-dynamics under coherent (laser) irradiation are calculated, including Quasi-Resonant and (Stimulated) Raman Adiabatic Passage conditions [2,6].

The help and input of Prof. Martin Quack, Prof. Jürgen Stohner, and Dr. Martin Willeke are highly appreciated. We are indebted to Dr. David Luckhaus who contributed greatly to use of DVR representations and supervised the original implementation of the RPH-method due to Fehrensen et al.
